# Welcome to PluripotentAGI's PolyGPT-alpha! 🚀🎉

# PolyGPT Project

👋 Welcome to the PolyGPT project! 🚀 PolyGPT is an ambitious undertaking aimed at developing an optimal Bayesian agent with the ability to self-learn, self-grow, and self-evolve 🌱🧠 using cutting-edge techniques such as Bayesian deep learning 📊🧮 and hyperbolic deep learning 🌐. In this README, we'll provide an overview of the project's goals and vision. 🌟

**Project Goals 🎯**
PolyGPT's primary objective is to create an advanced AI agent capable of making optimal decisions 🤖📈 based on the information it possesses. Here are the key objectives:

**Short-Term Goals 📅**
Initially, our focus is on participating in hackathons 💻🏆 to generate code 💻 and generate revenue 💰. This will provide us with the resources needed for further research and development. 💡🔬

**Long-Term Vision 🚀**
The ultimate goal is to transform PolyGPT into an optimal Bayesian agent 🌌🤯, a concept inspired by Nick Bostrom's book, "Superintelligence" 📚. An optimal Bayesian agent is one that can update its beliefs perfectly 🧠🔄 according to Bayesian's theorem 📊 when presented with new evidence 🆕.

**Bayesian and Hyperbolic Deep Learning 🧬🌀**
To achieve this vision, we aim to leverage Bayesian deep learning 📈🔍 and hyperbolic deep learning 🌐🧠 techniques to embed information in hyperbolic space 🚀🌌. This approach can offer better ways to understand and process data. 📊🗂️

**Self-Improvement 🔄💡**
Just like true AGI, the core of PolyGPT is its ability to self-learn 📚🧠, self-grow 🌱📈, and self-evolve 🔄🤖. It will continually refine its understanding and beliefs as it gains more information and experiences. 🌟📖

**Why PolyGPT? ❓**
The motivation behind PolyGPT is to explore avenues beyond the conventional approaches to AGI. While many are focused on large language models (LLMs) 📚📏 and optimization techniques 📈🛠️, we aim to investigate the potential of optimal Bayesian agents as a pathway to AGI. 🌐🤖🚀
